This is a bootstrap onepager promoting a project which was realized at the German government hackathon #wirvsvirus

The hotline is intended to provide a first point of contact for citizens in search of competent recommendations for action. Here, a comprehensive questionnaire on the risk of infection and health situation is discussed with the callers. The questionnaire is based on the self-test of the Berlin Charité.

In addition to competent recommendations for action and information on how to proceed, the caller receives a word pair. The information given in the telephone call can be traced via the word pair (see https://wirvsvirus-pwa.firebaseapp.com/). This solution encodes only the word pair for the given answering process in compliance with data protection and is therefore not person-specific.

It is therefore up to the caller to decide whether to pass on his answers to third parties by passing on the word pair. Clinics and practices already use the QR Code as an interface for their existing hospital information systems. We also convert the word pair into a standardized QR code and thus support the existing process.
